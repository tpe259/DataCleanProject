### Raw data description

The features selected in the raw data come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

### Variables retained in the tidy data set

As described above, the original data contain many statistical summaries of other fields - eg. interquartile range (IQR), kurtosis.  Only mean and standard deviation ("std") have been retained in the tidy data set, and are indicated by the inclusion of the strings "mean" or "std" in the field name.  The "meanFreq" variables were not retained.

66 observation columns have been retained in the tidy data set, plus two further columns indicating test subject and activity being performed.

The data included in the tidy data set is a summarisation of the raw data, by taking the mean of the mean and standard deviation values from the original data, across each subject-activity pair in the data.

### Values of variables

The study was performed using 30 participants.  Therefore the "Subject" variable ranges from 1 to 30.

The "Activity" variable is a factor taking one of the six values "Walking", "Walking upstairs", "Walking downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing" or "Lying down".

All raw measurement variables take values between -1 and 1.  Accordingly, all the mean and standard deviation variables in the tidy data set also lie in this range.

Since there are six activities and 30 test subjects, we have 180 means calculated for each of the 66 observation variables.
